# Airline Delay Mapper

A visualization of airline delays from the [2016 Bureau of Transportation Statistics](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time). Data are extracted for delay times and taxi times and can be filtered by airline, airport, route, and time of year.

Only U.S. airports with greater than 100,000 enplanements (passenger boardings) per year are displayed.
